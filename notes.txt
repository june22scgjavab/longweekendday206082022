HOPE YOU TRIED CREATING AN APPLICATION SIMILAR TO springdatademo. 

https://github.com/june22scgjavab/longweekendday105082022

So are you able to
recollect what are the annotations used and what are the methods related to 
CrudRepository interface?

In the current application , springdataaoploggerdemo, the logger got added and
is logged with AOP. I hope you have revised AOP programming and Logging with Log4j.

If not please revise and then check this demo code.

HAPPY LEARNING!!!!!!!!
